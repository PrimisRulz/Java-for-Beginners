Variables are containers for storing data values. These containers store a variety of things. All you need to do to set one up is through a line of code that looks something like this:

variabletype variablename = value;

Where variabletype is, add a variable such as String, or int. For the variablename, put whatever you want the name of this variable to be. (We call these identifiers)

2. You also have Display/Print Variables, which are things such as "print" and "println()". These basically allow you to display the code you specify.

3. You can also declare multiple variables on a single line of code, rather than manually declaring each variable on seperate lines.

4. Finally, we cover Identifiers. These are basically the names of what you set for all of your custom variables.

Each of these variables will be expanded upon in the "Variables" folder, with examples for each of course
