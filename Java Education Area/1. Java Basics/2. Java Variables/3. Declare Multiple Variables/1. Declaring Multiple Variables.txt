You can declare more than one variable of the same type if you use a comma-seperated list.

So instead of typing:

int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

You could instead type:

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z)

You can also assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

Go ahead and give it a try! Remember, there are example files just in case your code doesn't work!
