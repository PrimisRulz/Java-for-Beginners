All variables must be identified with unique names. These names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be as short as a single character(X, or Y are some examples), or can be more descriptive (age, sum, and totalVolume are some examples)

There is an example file called "Identifier.java" which shows you how an identifer could be coded.

There are general rules for naming Variables:

Names CAN contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
Names MUST begin with a letter
Names SHOULD (but are not required to) start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
Names CAN also begin with $ and _
Names ARE CASE-SENSITIVE ("myVar" and "myvar" are two different variables)
Reserved words (like java keywords such as int, boolean, etc.) cannot be used as names.

(Do these rules look familiar? They should as they are the same rules that apply to your class/file names!)
