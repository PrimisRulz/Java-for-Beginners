Java Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Operators are things like + as example.

+ Operator is used to add two values together. These aren't limited to numerical values, but can also be used on variables.

Operators fall into the following groups:

  Arithmetic operators

  Used to perform common mathematical operations. The operators used here are shown in below:

Operator | Name           | Description                            | Example
+        | Addition       | Adds together two values               | x + y
-        | Subtraction    | Subtracts one value from another       | x - y
*        | Multiplication | Multiplies two values                  | x * y
/        | Division       | Divides one value by another           | x / y
%        | Modulus        | Returns the division remainder         | x % y
++       | Increment      | Increases the value of a variable by 1 | ++x
--       | Decrement      | Decreases the value of a variable by 1 | --x

Assignment operators

  Used to assign values to variables, for example saying x = 10.
  The complete list of assignment operators is as follows:

             (Use)    (Don't Use)
Operator | Examples | Same As    | What they do
   =     | x = 5    | x = 5      | Obvious
  +=     | x += 3   | x = x + 3  | Additon
  -=     | x -= 3   | x = x - 3  | Subtraction
  *=     | x *= 3   | x = x * 3  | Multiplication   
  /=     | x /= 3   | x = x / 3  | Division
  %=     | x %= 3   | x = x % 3  | Gives remainder of division (if you divide 5 by 3, the remainder is 2)
  &=     | x &= 3   | x = x & 3  | (Unknown)
  |=     | x |= 3   | x = x | 3  | (Unknown)
  ^=     | x ^= 3   | x = x ^ 3  | (Unknown)
  >>=    | x >>= 3  | x = x >> 3 | (Unknown)
  <<=    | x <<= 3  | x = x << 3 | (Unknown)

  Comparison operators

  Used to compare two values or variables. Return values are boolean values.
  The list below shows all comparison Operators:

Operator | Name                     | Example
==       | Equal to                 | x == y
!=       | Not equal                | x != y
>        | Greater than             | x > y
<        | Less than                | x < y
>=       | Greater than or equal to | x >= y
<=       | Less than or equal to    | x <= y

  Logical operators

  Can be used to test for "true" or "false" values and are used to determine the logic between variables or values. The list below shows all logical operators:

Operator | Name        | Description                                             | Example
&&       | Logical and | Returns true if both statements are true                | x < 5 && x < 10
||       | Logical or  | Returns true if one of the statements are true          | x < 5 || x < 4
!        | Logical not | Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true | !(x < 5 && x < 10)

  Bitwise operators
