Data Type    Size      Description

byte        1 byte     Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127

Integer Types use values such as byte, short, int and long. Which value you should use is dependant on the numeric value.
Floating point types are for numbers with decimals. The two types of values for these are float and double. Again, whcich value you use is dependant on the numeric value

byte: Can be used to save memory when you are certain the vaule is within -128 to 127.
short: Is used to store numbers from -32768 to 32767
int: Is the most commonly used and preferred data type.
long: Is only used when the value for "int" isn't big enough

Floating Point Types are used when numeric values include decimals. Doubles are used more commonly as their calculations are more precise

float: Is used when decimals are involved (6 or 7 digit max) (when typing out the "myNum" value, end the value with f)
double: Is used more often than float as its more precise with calculations (15 digit max) (when typing out the "myNum" value, end the value with d)

Scientific Numbers - A "float" value can be a scientific number using "e" to indicate the power of 10
